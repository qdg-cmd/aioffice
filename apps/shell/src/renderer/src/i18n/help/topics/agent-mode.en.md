# Agent mode

The agent takes one folder you choose as a project and runs Claude Code or Codex from this PC in that folder. The AI reads the material in the folder itself, creates new files, uses skills and scripts, and edits the documents open in GenOffice. Use it for work that draws on a lot of material.

## Before you start

- A Claude subscription or a ChatGPT subscription connected under **Settings ▸ AI**. The "Subscription connection" topic explains how.
- A folder with your material in it. A whole drive, your whole home folder, and folders of sign-in or app data cannot be chosen.

## Starting a session

1. In the left sidebar of Home, click **Agent**. The agent window opens on its own.
2. Click **Choose a folder…** to pick the project folder. Folders you used recently are listed under **Recent folders**.
3. Under **Program**, choose Claude Code or Codex. A program that is not connected cannot be chosen.
4. Under **When to ask you**, choose how the agent asks for permission (table below).
5. The first time, read **Before you start** and click **I understand**.
6. Click **Start**, write what you want done, and click **Send**.

One window is one session. Closing the window or clicking **Stop** ends the session, and the program GenOffice started for it ends too. A session also ends after 30 minutes with nothing sent.

## How the agent asks

| Choice                                 | Goes ahead                                                              | Asks first                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ask before every command** (default) | Reading and writing files in the project folder, editing open documents | Running a command or script, reading outside the project folder         |
| **Ask before writing and commands**    | Reading files in the project folder, editing open documents             | Writing a file, running a command or script, reading outside the folder |
| **Trust this project**                 | Almost everything                                                       | Reading outside the project folder                                      |

When the agent asks, the window shows what it wants to do (the whole command, the file path). Click **Allow** or **Decline**.

Whatever you choose, the agent does not:

- Overwrite the file of a document open in a GenOffice tab. Open documents are edited through the app, so the change shows in the editor at once and the editor's undo takes it back.
- Write outside the project folder.
- Touch the sign-in data of Claude or Codex, or GenOffice's data folder.

## Claude Code and Codex

- **Codex** runs commands in its own isolated space, including the ones you allow. It can write only in the project folder, the internet is blocked unless you turn it on, and it cannot read your personal files outside the project. When a session starts, GenOffice first checks that this isolation works on this PC, and does not start if it does not.
- **Claude Code** cannot isolate commands on Windows. A command you allow can reach the whole PC and the internet. That is why, under **Trust this project**, Claude Code's own reviewer checks each action instead of you.

A document someone sent you can carry hidden instructions that tell the AI to do something else. In a folder of material you do not know, use one of the choices that ask.

## Web search and the internet

- **Claude Code** can search the web and read web pages, and asks first. It asks the first time it searches, and for each site whose pages it reads. In the question, **Allow searches for this session** or **Allow this site for this session** stops it asking again for the rest of the session. Under **Trust this project**, Claude Code's own reviewer decides.
- When you choose **Codex**, the start screen shows two more settings.

| Setting                          | Choices                    | At first      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Web search**                   | Saved results / Live / Off | Saved results |
| **Internet access for commands** | Off / On                   | Off           |

- Saved results come from web content collected in advance; Live searches the web as it is now.
- Both settings are remembered for each project folder. A folder used for the first time starts with the values above.
- With internet access for commands on, the commands Codex runs can reach the internet. Under **Trust this project** they reach it without asking, and hidden instructions in a document you received could make them send your data out. This warning appears when you turn it on. Turn it on only when you need it. The built-in skill "Find skills" works only with this setting on.

## Project notes and skills

- If the folder has a `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, its contents are given to the agent as instructions. Write down what should hold every time: tone, terms, the format of the documents to make.
- The agent window uses the skills turned on in **Settings ▸ Skills**. Claude Code and Codex get the same list. More about skills is in [Skills](help://skills).
- Skills in the project folder's `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills` are used in that session without being turned on.
- Pick a skill with `/` or `$` in the input box, and an instruction to read and follow that skill is put in front of your request.
- The skill list is fixed when the session starts. If you turn skills on or off during a session, "Changed skills apply from the next session" appears.
- When the agent makes a skill, a skill card appears in the window; when it finds a skill worth installing, an install preview appears. Nothing is saved or installed until you click **Save** or **Install**, and an installed skill is available from the next session.
- Programs a skill's scripts use (Python and so on) must be installed on this PC.
- If you used the agent in an earlier version, the first time you open the agent window a one-time notice says: "Skills are now turned on and off in Settings → Skills. Skills in the Claude and Codex skill folders start turned off." **Open Settings** takes you straight there.

## New files and open documents

- New files the agent makes are saved in the project folder. Click **Open** on that line of the progress log to open the file in a GenOffice tab.
- To have an open document edited, open it in GenOffice first and name it in your request.
- A document you open during a session can be edited from your next message on.

## Privacy and usage

- What you hid from the AI stays hidden only when the app reads a document open in GenOffice for the agent. Files the agent reads from the folder itself are sent as they are.
- Web search terms and the addresses of pages read go to the program's company and to those sites. With Codex's internet access for commands on, data can go wherever a command connects.
- The agent works in many steps, so it uses more of your subscription limit than the AI panel. When the limit runs out, the request fails; the agent never moves to another AI or to a connection that is billed.

## If something goes wrong

| What the window says                      | What to do                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not connected**                         | Sign in to that program under **Settings ▸ AI**.    |
| **This folder cannot be used**            | Choose a folder that holds only your work material. |
| **Codex cannot open the sandbox**         | Update Windows, or choose Claude Code.              |
| **Your subscription limit is used up**    | Send again after the limit resets.                  |
| **The program is too old for agent mode** | Update that program, then click **New session**.    |
